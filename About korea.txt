        <h2 class="first-reason">why I want to visit there</h2>
        <p>Because I'm interested in <em>Korean beauty</em> and an actor called<strong>Park Soe-joon</strong>. There are many good products that I like to try and don't see in japan. And of corse I like makeup products as well!!<br>
            I barely have a favorite celebrity but since I watched <em>"Itaewon class" </em>which is my favorite and other movies and dreams, I'm in to love with him. People who don't know about him, here is his picture. He's tall and has a good body. I've never met him but I see his personality is great.lol </p>

            <h2 class="second-paragraph">What I want to do there</h2>
            <p>I have <em>two things for that</em>. I want to get some skincare products that I've been curious about. A city called  Myeong-dong is known for beauty city so I'm gonna try to go there.<br>Second one is eating foods. I love eating and like Korean foods although I'm not good at a spicy food. There are a lot of good foods in Korea especially what I'm looking forward to eating is<em><strong> bulgogi </strong>which means Korean barbecue.</em></p>
            
            <p class="last-messages">It's hard to travel in this situation but I hope someday I get to go travel to my favorite country. Stay safe guys!!
